This is a list of notes that were taken during the sessions. ADHD is a struggle week after week and day after day. Battling inconsistency and trying to complete tasks in a timely manner is very difficult for the ADHA brain. I still struggle to implement these and I fall off a lot. My wife has the most patience in the world for me and it's important to find someone like that to help push and motivate you to be a better version of yourself. This road is rough, bumpy, and sometimes closed so it takes time and a tremendous amount of mental effort. The below list is not weighted the number values do not mean more importance.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest takeaways for me was this. Our lives are defined by the questions WE are asking OURSELVES (#10). This can be the difference between 2 simple words. You most likely are asking yourself “HOW?”. When asked to complete a task or when it is very tough to find the motivation to start a task. We are continually asking ourselves “HOW?”. How can I do this? How can I do that? This continues to lead to the failure of finishing the task. The word you need to start asking yourself is “WHAT?”. A simple mental hack is to think of WHAT right away when thinking about your task. “What do I have to do to start this?” What can I do to achieve this? This could also be applied in a different light. Asking yourself the same questions in a different light could change your output. ADHD is a struggle to start and complete tasks so applying this approach can help create progress. Think outside the box and start asking yourself new questions.</p>\n<p>Secondly, The act of being intentional. Life is driven by intention decision making and planning. What is your intention with this task? Living with intention is being proactive and aiming for goals. This view will broaden your horizons in life. Intention comes hand in hand with increasing your chances of success each day. The more intentional you are about a task the higher the chances of success are. An example If you are forgetting your keys and wallet sometimes cause you are rushing out the door. By leaving these in a catch-all basket or area near your door that can be grabbed each time before exiting. This will take time to build into a routine. Keep putting the items there and walking out then doing a small task for a minute or two. Rinse and repeat. This will help build muscle memory even if it is small. There is a difference between planning and intention. With ADHD it is very hard to plan. I want to avoid planning. Planning is 100% expecting a certain outcome. The intention is to set a goal and achieve it with a bit of flexibility. Now, these two do relate to each other and you can have planning be a part of being intentional likewise you can have intention be a part of the plan.</p>\n<h3>List of Lessons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Wife (or another family member) holds a new needed level of focus</li>\n<li>Drop what you are doing and listen without a response</li>\n<li>Invest in the ability to bounce back up</li>\n<li>Be Calm and Collective</li>\n<li>To-Do List Written</li>\n<li>Daily/Monthly/Yearly Planner\n<ul>\n<li>Notion List</li>\n<li>Sticky Notes on the phone</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Rethink your morning routine</li>\n<li>Ask yourself - “What is your default?”\n<ul>\n<li>Related to your ways of being</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What do you fall back into when something changes in your life?</li>\n<li>Massive Growth can occur when you are OPEN &#x26; WILLING.</li>\n<li>It is BEST to prove yourself WRONG</li>\n<li>Understand LONG TERM vs SHORT TERM success</li>\n<li>Long-term = best</li>\n<li>Short-term = short-lived</li>\n<li>Ask yourself (write down if needed)\n<ul>\n<li>WHAT IS A LEADER?</li>\n<li>WHAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF A LEADER?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Your life is defined by the current questions you are asking yourself.</li>\n<li>Think outside the box</li>\n<li>start asking yourself new questions.\n<ul>\n<li>OR ask the same questions from a new light</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Allow taking actions on #10.</li>\n<li>Fall for nothing -> I’ll find a way mentality</li>\n<li>Living life with INTENTION.
