<h2><em>WIP</em> 3 pools of companies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start up</strong> is a face paced environment where you are engaged in daily <strong>coding</strong> work and practices. If you get a chance. I do feel a start up is worth it ..</li>
<li><strong>Brands</strong> usually has a established <strong>tech stack</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Consultants/Agency</strong> usually has a <strong>wide range</strong> of technoogies. These technologies are dependent on client's needs are could vary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, <strong>What sold me</strong> was the knowledge I was going to be exposed to. Start up's tend to be smaller teams where you will handle and touch a lot of code. It gives you an opportunity to dive into their tech stack and be a short distance away to turn and ask a question when needed. Start up's tend to move fast and preach that agility is a main strength to omving into a success long term path. This environment of moving fast tosses you in the mix at a rate that, for a post bootcamp graduate, is awesome! You will have opportunity to work solo, pair program, group program, and more.</p>
