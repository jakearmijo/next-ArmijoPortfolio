Start up's tend to be smaller teams where you will handle and touch a lot of code. It gives you an opportunity to dive into their tech stack and be a short distance away to turn and ask a question when needed. Start up's tend to move fast and preach that agility is a main strength to moving into a success long term path. This environment of moving fast tosses you in the mix at a rate that, for a post bootcamp graduate, is awesome! You will have opportunity to work solo, pair program, group program, and more.</p>\n<p>Jake Armijo | Full Stack Software Engineer\nConnect with me on LinkedIn\nSchedule a meeting with me on Calendly</p>\n","title":"Where to start your SDE career","date":"2022-07-05","category":"Guidance/Advice","template":"blog-post","tags":"Startups, Brands, Consultants, Agency"}},"__N_SSG":true}
