{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"where-to-start","contentHtml":"<h2>Where to start your SDE career - (Work in progress)</h2>\n<p>After graduating from coding Bootcamp I landed a job at a Chicago start-up. During the job hunt phase, I was always reading job descriptions and looking at different companies' websites. It is a lot of information to take in. Where do you start? Which company do you choose?  For most people that answer - I think - is the first place to give you an offer. Use this in your search to aid in your decision-making. I like to think of companies in three pools.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Startups</strong> is a face paced environment where you are engaged in daily <strong>coding</strong> work and practices.</li>\n<li><strong>Brands</strong> usually has an established <strong>tech stack</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Agencies</strong> usually have a <strong>wide range</strong> of technologies. These technologies are dependent on clients' needs and could vary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Start-Up</h3>\n<p>Start-ups are a great place for you to start up... These companies have a tendency to be more modern. Most likely every day you will be coding and learning in a defined tech stack. I assume with the rise of cloud technologies some of these companies will also be able to give you experience with a major cloud provider. Start-ups come in a variety of sizes but usually lean towards the smaller end. This is an advantage when trying to gain XP and learn. Your teammates sit close to you and can assist with issues or questions. These environments are faster-paced and very agile. I am generally speaking so people may have different experiences or opinions. You will be involved in daily coding stand-ups, roadmap discussions, and depending on the size maybe even some marketing and business acquisition. In my experience, these companies don't always pay as much as brands or agencies. My entry-level salary was only $55k. The knowledge and experience gained are the trade-offs for the money. Sometimes these companies will offer stock or ownership in your contract. Just be very careful here while in negotiation cause unless you really have a connection with these people they are only looking out for their \"baby\" (product) and will say what they can to get you on board at a lower salary. This isn't always true but just weary while you swim through these waters... There are sharks around. In the end, the XP and the knowledge gained, as stated before, is of more value to you anyway unless you see yourself staying there forever. If you get a chance. I do feel a start-up is worth the time investment but again just make sure you are going to learn, build your skills, develop your technical lingo, and expand your professional network.</p>\n<h3>Brands</h3>\n<p>Here I want to talk about a specific brand and showcase that they are a defined tech stack that you would learn and get good with. Working at a brand is in my opinion pretty consistent. These companies have defined their technology stack and stick to it. They are making improvements or creating new features but they are all using or should be using, the same technology that the brand is based on. You will gain more in-depth knowledge of a specific technology and be able to keep improving your abilities.</p>\n<h4>Examples of Random Brands</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.Hubspot.com\">Hubspot</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pamperedchef.com/\">Pampered Chef</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.capitalonecareers.com/\">Capital One</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.Workday.com\">Workday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.Zapier.com\">Zapier</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Consultants</h3>\n<p>Here I want to talk about my current experience and how I have already learned new technologies and researched more every day. Every project I am on is not always the same tech stack. I have picked up a new programming language as well as several other technologies that I never used or even knew existed. Although this is a bit of inconsistency for my ADHD brain. It helps that I can hyper-focus and obsess over these technologies while building the project. Shorter sprints and project durations give me a chance to dabble in a wide variety of things. I am always working with new clients and new companies. This challenges you to learn things in a fast-paced environment and be able to apply them to a production-level application.</p>\n<h2>Importantly</h2>\n<p><strong>What sold me</strong> was the knowledge I was going to be exposed to. Start up tend to be smaller teams where you will handle and touch a lot of code. It gives you an opportunity to dive into their tech stack and be a short distance away to turn and ask a question when needed. Start up's tend to move fast and preach that agility is the main strength to moving into a successful long-term path. This environment of moving fast tosses you in the mix at a rate that, for a post-Bootcamp graduate, is awesome! You will have the opportunity to work solo, in pairs, in groups, and more.</p>\n<p>Jake Armijo <strong>|</strong> Full Stack Software Engineer\n</p>\n<p>Connect with me on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-armijo/\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n<p>Schedule a meeting with me on <a href=\"https://calendly.com/armijojake/meeting\">Calendly</a></p>\n","title":"Where to start your SDE career","date":"2022-07-05","category":"Guidance/Advice","template":"blog-post","tags":"Startups, Brands, Consultants, Agency"}},"__N_SSG":true}
