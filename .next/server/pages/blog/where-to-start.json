If you get a chance. I do feel a start up is worth it ..</li>\n<li><strong>Brands</strong> usually has a established <strong>tech stack</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Consultants/Agency</strong> usually has a <strong>wide range</strong> of technoogies. These technologies are dependent on client's needs are could vary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Importantly, <strong>What sold me</strong> was the knowledge I was going to be exposed to. Start up's tend to be smaller teams where you will handle and touch a lot of code. It gives you an opportunity to dive into their tech stack and be a short distance away to turn and ask a question when needed. Start up's tend to move fast and preach that agility is a main strength to omving into a success long term path. This environment of moving fast tosses you in the mix at a rate that, for a post bootcamp graduate, is awesome! You will have opportunity to work solo, pair program, group program, and more.</p>\n<p>Jake Armijo | Full Stack Software Engineer\nConnect with me on LinkedIn\nSchedule a meeting with me on Calendly</p>\n","title":"Where to start","date":"2021-05-03","category":"Guidance/Advice","template":"blog-post","tags":"Startups, Brands, Consultants, Agency"}},"__N_SSG":true}
