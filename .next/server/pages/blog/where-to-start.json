{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"where-to-start","contentHtml":"<h2>Where to start your SDE career</h2>\n<p>After graduating from coding Bootcamp I landed a job at a Chicago start-up. During the job hunt phase, I was always reading job descriptions and looking at different companies' websites. It is a lot of information to take in. Where do you start? Which company do you choose?  For most people that answer - I think - is the first place to give you an offer. Use this in your search to aid in your decision-making. I like to think of companies in three pools.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Startups</strong> is a face paced environment where you are engaged in daily <strong>coding</strong> work and practices.</li>\n<li><strong>Brands</strong> usually has an established <strong>tech stack</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Consulting Firm</strong> usually have a <strong>wide range</strong> of technologies. These technologies are dependent on clients' needs and could vary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Start-Up</h3>\n<p>Start-ups are a great place for you to start up... These companies have a tendency to be more modern. Most likely every day you will be coding and learning in a defined tech stack. I assume with the rise of cloud technologies some of these companies will also be able to give you experience with a major cloud provider. Start-ups come in a variety of sizes but usually lean towards the smaller end. This is an advantage when trying to gain XP and learn. Your teammates sit close to you and can assist with issues or questions. These environments are faster-paced and very agile. I am generally speaking so people may have different experiences or opinions. You will be involved in daily coding stand-ups, roadmap discussions, and depending on the size maybe even some marketing and business acquisition. In my experience, these companies don't always pay as much as brands or agencies. My entry-level salary was only $55k. The knowledge and experience gained are the trade-offs for the money. Sometimes these companies will offer stock or ownership in your contract. Just be very careful here while in negotiation cause unless you really have a connection with these people they are only looking out for their \"baby\" (product) and will say what they can to get you on board at a lower salary. This isn't always true but just weary while you swim through these waters... There are sharks around. In the end, the XP and the knowledge gained, as stated before, is of more value to you anyway unless you see yourself staying there forever. If you get a chance. I do feel a start-up is worth the time investment but again just make sure you are going to learn, build your skills, develop your technical lingo, and expand your professional network.</p>\n<h3>Brands</h3>\n<p>Let's talk about brands. A brand is a type of product manufactured by a particular company under a particular name. Working at a brand might be more consistent than say working at a consulting firm. These companies have defined their engineering processes and their tech stack. They have a team or teams of engineers that you would join and be placed on. A brand may have been a startup at one time but now has scaled enough that they are solidified. They are making improvements or creating new features but they are all using or should be using, the same technology that the brand is based on. You will gain more in-depth knowledge of a specific technology and be able to keep improving your abilities. You will learn and grow with other engineers around you and have opportunities to contribute to the brand or product. I have never worked at a brand so this section is a little difficult to write. I write this from the outside looking in.</p>\n<h4>Examples of Random Brands</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.Hubspot.com\">Hubspot</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pamperedchef.com/\">Pampered Chef</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.capitalonecareers.com/\">Capital One</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.Workday.com\">Workday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.Zapier.com\">Zapier</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Consulting Firm</h3>\n<p>Here I want to talk about my current experience and how I have already learned new technologies and researched more every day. A consultant is a person who provides expert advice professionally. Every project I am on is not always the same tech stack. I have picked up a new technologies that I never used or even knew existed. Although this is a bit of inconsistency for my ADHD brain. It helps that I can hyper-focus and obsess over these technologies while building the project. Shorter sprints and project durations give me a chance to dabble in a wide variety of things. I am always working with new clients and new companies, which is something I love. This challenges you to learn things in a fast-paced environment and be able to apply them to a production-level application. You will work with many other companies and talk with many other people. You interact with people from all sorts of titles (not always engineers). Different stakeholders are usually involved in the meetings and you see how other companies operate. You are hired by a client to make what they need and guide them down the proper path. After you complete the projet you may never go back to that project again. Which does sometime leave a bad taste if you know there was something you could have improved or something that just wasnt quite right. This is a great place to start your career as well!</p>\n<h2>Importantly</h2>\n<p>Overall it is on you to decide. Any path you choose is fine. They all have pros and cons and it's on you to make the best of the choice you made. For me, it was a start-up. What sold me was the knowledge I was going to be exposed to. I recommend any of these paths to anyone who is searching. If you have any questions or want to make some comments just reach out to me. Don't take this as a bible as this is just me writing my personal thoughts and about my personal experience. Everyone is different and like I said it is ON YOU to decide. I hope this gave you some small insight into the scene and more information when making your decision.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jakearmijo.com/\">Jake Armijo</a> <strong>|</strong> Full Stack Software Engineer\n</p>\n<p>Connect with me on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-armijo/\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n<p>Schedule a meeting with me on <a href=\"https://calendly.com/armijojake/meeting\">Calendly</a></p>\n","title":"Where to start your SDE career","date":"2022-07-05","category":"Guidance/Advice","template":"blog-post","tags":"Startups, Brands, Consultants, Agency"}},"__N_SSG":true}
