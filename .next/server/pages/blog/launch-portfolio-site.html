<hr>
<p>Hello Everyone, I knew I wanted to create my website a little while ago. I looked at different tech options and tried to select which one would be best. I knew <strong><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a></strong> were popular choices so I mainly researched those. After Boot camp, I did make a full <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React-based portfolio</a>, but it was large and slow on load time. I knew I could research how to improve this, but I thought I would change the pace and try something new. I was reading about how server-side rendering would be better for load time. I chose Next over Gatsby because I thought it was a bit newer. I enjoyed the Next tutorials while going through them, so I converted the React-based project into a Next.js project.</p>
<p>When I started to research domains and where to purchase them, I checked GoDaddy first (just because I'm 30 and I've always seen and heard their name) I also stumbled into Google Domains which I quickly leaned towards as the price was even with the range I was seeing and I wanted to have something from a brand I knew. I also came across sites such as  <a href="https://www.a2hosting.com/">A2</a>, <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/content/bluehost/en">Bluehost</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, or <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>. I honestly have no advice as I'm sure if you have made it this far the process is decently simple with any provider you chose. In the end, the final check-out price was $12 for 1 year that I set to reoccurring. There was also an option on there to have a "work" email address. For example, you can choose info@jakearmijo.com or something along those lines. This was an addon for <a href="https://workspace.google.com/">Google Workspace</a> and was $6 per user per month and came with 30GB of cloud storage.</p>
<h2>Netlify</h2>
<p>I watched this <strong><a href="https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/nextjs">incredible tutorial</a></strong> by <a href="https://cassidoo.co/">Cassidoo</a> and I applied it to my site in order to get it up and running with a basic Netlify URL. The process for Netlify to add my custom domain after I had purchased it from google domains is posted below.</p>
<p><img src="../public/images/netlifyLogo.png" alt="Netlify"></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Step By Step How To - Netlify</h3>
<ol>
<li>In your Netlify console, navigate to your site and click Domain Settings. Click the green button "Add a custom domain".</li>
<li>It will prompt you to provide the name of the domain you have bought. For example <strong><a href="https://www.jakearmijo.com">https://www.jakearmijo.com</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Verify that you are the owner of the domain.</li>
<li>Click "verify".</li>
<li>You will be redirected to your domain settings where you will see your domain. You will see that your domain will have a warning, asking you to "check your DNS configuration". Click to Options -> Set Up Netlify DNS.</li>
<li>Add domain - Netlify will ask you to re-verify your domain name</li>
<li>Add DNS records - The DNS records for your Netlify sites will be configured automatically. I did not have an email account with the domain so I skipped this part.</li>
<li>Activate Netlify DNS - Netlify will give you the names of their name savers. Keep them open and head to google domains.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Google Domains</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Step By Step How To - Google</h3>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your domain settings</li>
<li>Click DNS</li>
<li>In the NameServers box, select the option "Use custom nameservers". Before I was able to add the custom domains, it made me disable DNSSEC.</li>
<li>Add the name servers from Netlify to the Google name servers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Congrats! Your domain is set up - it may take more time but mine was ready within minutes. That is how <a href="https://www.jakearmijo.com">https://www.jakearmijo.com</a> was born.</p>
<p>Netlify will also set up the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/">HTTPS certificate</a> via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/donate/">letsencrypt.org</a>. This process took a little longer but when I awoke in the morning I had the HTTPS before the URL and my site was not receiving a privacy warning.</p>
