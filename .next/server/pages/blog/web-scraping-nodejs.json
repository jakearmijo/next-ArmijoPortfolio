I could utilize web scraping. Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting information from websites. Although it can be used for a wide variety of things (some good and some not good) some Useful examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website URLs</li>\n<li>Product Prices (Personal use only)</li>\n<li>Betting Odds?</li>\n<li>Market research</li>\n<li>Fun and Creativity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should ask yourself: \"Could a script take less time with more results than doing this <strong>by hand</strong> ?\" If the answer is yes, then you should write a script to achieve this.</p>\n<p>Although it is not as advanced as a full web scraping script a simple query selector is a very powerful tool. Paired with a reduce and a map and you have the power to grab a bunch of useful targeted information off a webpage.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, sometimes it is much easier to just grab the few results that are listed with the ole copy-paste. Selectors are <strong>not</strong> always a good idea if you cannot find them quickly and have them achieve lots of results.</p>\n<p>In the below examples, I will showcase how to use a <strong>CSS selector</strong> to grab info off a webpage. In these examples, it could be faster to use this technique, but doing it the long way (copy-paste each item) will always be available.</p>\n<p><strong>2 EXAMPLES -></strong> 1 reduce 1 map\nIn the example we are going to be imagining we are trying to grab a bunch of different eCommerce websites to save for a later date. In a later section we might export all these results to a CSV file, but for now, will just be copying and pasting them into a separate .csv we will open up in a new vs code window.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open Chrome and navigate to <a href=\"https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/woocommerce/case-studies/all\">featuredcustomers.com</a>. This is the website we will be grabbing all of our URLs from.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>MAP EXAMPLE -> can add in the .com to query and show that as well</strong>\n<code>Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.caseStudy-card-heading > a'))     .map(({title, innerHTML} ) => ({ URL: \"https://\" + title + \".com\"     .split(\" \")     .join(), name: title, source: 'https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/'}))</code></p>\n<p><strong>REDUCE -> https://www.silksoftware.com/work/</strong>\n<code>Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.content-center')).reduce((previous, element) => {     console.log(\"element\", element)     const { href } = element.querySelectorAll('a')     const { innerText } = element.querySelectorAll('.category')       return [...previous,{ url: undefined, name: innerHTML, source: 'https://netalico.com/', provider:innerText }]}, [])</code></p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong> —> —> —></p>\n<p>Or you can skip everything and just spend around $500 USD to buy the information or data you want from a site that already has been doing this for years.</p>\n<p>Jake Armijo <strong>|</strong> Full Stack Software Engineer\n</p>\n<p>Connect with me on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-armijo/\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n<p>Schedule a meeting with me on <a href=\"https://calendly.com/armijojake/meeting\">Calendly</a></p>\n","title":"Web Scraping and how to utilize reduce and map inside chrome dev tool","date":"2021-04-30","category":"Tutorial","template":"blog-post","tags":"Google Dev Tools, Reduce, Map, Nodejs, Web Scraping"}},"__N_SSG":true}
