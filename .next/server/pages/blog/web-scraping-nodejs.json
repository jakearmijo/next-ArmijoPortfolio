I could utilize web scraping. Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting informaion from websites. Although it can be used for a wide variety of things (some good and some not good) some Useful examples include:</p>\n<p class=\"border\">\n- Website URLS\n</br>\n- Product Prices (Personal use only)\n</br>\n- Betting Odds?\n</br>\n- Market research\n</br>\n- Fun and Creativity\n</p>\n</br>\n<p>You should ask yourself: \"Could a script take less time with more results then doing this <strong>by hand</strong> ?\" If the answer is yes, then you should write a script to achieve this.</p>\n<p>Although it is not as advanced as a full web sraping script a simple query selector is a very powerful tool. Paired with a reduce and a map and you have the power to grab a bunch of useful targeted information off a webpage.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, sometimes it is much easier to just grab the few results that are listed with the ole copy paste. Selectors are <strong>not</strong> always a good idea if you cannot find them quick and have them achieve lots of results.</p>\n<p>In the below examples, I will showcase how to use a <strong>css selector</strong> to grab info off a webpage. In this examples it could be faster to use this technique, but doing it the long way (copy paste each item) will always be available.\n<strong>2 EXAMPLES -></strong> 1 reduce 1 map</p>\n<div class=\"border\">\n  <p>\nIn these example we are going to be imagining we are trying to grab a bunch of different eCommerce websites to save for a later date. In a later section we might export all these results to a csv file, but for now will jusst be copying and pasting into a seperate .csv we will open up in a new vs code window. \n<p class=\"listItem\">1.) Open Chrome and navigate to <a href='https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/woocommerce/case-studies/all' target='_blank'>featuredcustomers.com</a>. This is the website we will be grabbing all of our URLs from.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MAP EXAMPLE -> can add in the .com to query and show that as well\nCode ->\nArray.from(document.querySelectorAll('.caseStudy-card-heading > a')).map(({title, innerHTML} ) => ({ URL: \"https://\" + title + \".com\".split(\" \").join(), name: title, source: 'https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/'} ))</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n  <img\n      class=\"border\"\n      width=\"50%\"\n      height=\"50%\"\n      alt=\"Netlify\"\n      title=\"Netlify\"\n      src=\"https://download.logo.wine/logo/Netlify/Netlify-Logo.wine.png\"\n      data-canonical-src=\"https://download.logo.wine/logo/Netlify/Netlify-Logo.wine.png\"\n      />\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>REDUCE -> https://www.silksoftware.com/work/\nCode ->\nArray.from(document.querySelectorAll('.content-center'))\n.reduce((previous, element) => {\nconsole.log(\"element\", element)\nconst { href } = element.querySelectorAll('a')\nconst { innerText } = element.querySelectorAll('.category')\nreturn [\n...previous,\n{ url: undefined, name: innerHTML, source: 'https://netalico.com/', provider:innerText }\n]\n}, [])</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong> —> —> —></p>\n<p>Or you can skip everything and just spend around $500 USD to buy the information or data you want from a site that already has been doing this for years.</p>\n</div>\n","title":"Web Scraping and how to utilize reduce and map inside chrome dev tool","date":"2021-04-30","category":"Tutorial","template":"blog-post","tags":"Google Dev Tools, Reduce, Map, Nodejs, Web Scraping"}},"__N_SSG":true}
