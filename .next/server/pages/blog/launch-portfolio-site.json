I looked at a bunch of different tech options and tried to figure out which one would be best. I knew Next.js and Gatsby were popular choices so I mainly researched those. After Bootcamp, I did make a full React-based portfolio but it was very large and slow on load time. I knew I could research how to improve this but I thought I would change the pace and try something new. I was reading about how server-side rendering would be better for load time. I chose Next over Gatsby just because I thought it was a tad bit newer and I enjoyed the tutorials while I was going through them. So I converted the React-based project into a Next.js project and now I am using that going forward.</p>\n<p>When I started to research domains and where to purchase them. I checked GoDaddy first (just because I'm 30 and I've always seen and heard their name) I also stumbled into Google Domains which I quickly leaned towards as the price was even with the range I was seeing and I wanted to have something from a brand I knew. I also came across sites such as  A2, Bluehost, Netlify, or Namecheap. I honestly have no advice as I'm sure if you have made it this far the process is decently simple with any provider you chose. In the end, the final check-out price was $12 for 1 year that I set to reoccurring. There was also an option on there to have a \"work\" email address. For example, you can choose info@jakearmijo.com or something along those lines. This was added for Google Workspace and was $6 per user per month and came with 30GB of cloud storage. I thought about it for our family pictures cause my wife has been searching for a cloud option to store all of our pictures on. If anyone has any good experiences with any cloud-based photo storage such as google photos or amazon photos or anything please DM on LinkedIn</p>\n<div class=\"border\">\n  <img\n      class=\"border\"\n      width=\"50%\"\n      height=\"50%\"\n      alt=\"Netlify\"\n      title=\"Netlify\"\n      src=\"https://download.logo.wine/logo/Netlify/Netlify-Logo.wine.png\"\n      data-canonical-src=\"https://download.logo.wine/logo/Netlify/Netlify-Logo.wine.png\"\n    />\n</div>\n<p>\nI had already been toying with Netlify and my vanilla React portfolio before this transition. I watched an <strong><a href='https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/nextjs' target='_blank'>incredible tutorial</a></strong> by Cassidoo and I applied it to my site in order to get it up and running with a basic Netlify URL. The process for Netlify to add my custom domain after I had purchased it from google domains is as follows\n</p>\n</br>\n  <div class=\"list\">\n    <ol>\n      <p class=\"listItem\">1.) In your Netlify console, navigate to your site and click Domain Settings. Click the green button \"Add custom domain\".</p>\n      <p class=\"listItem\">2.) It will prompt you to provide the name of the domain you have bought. For example <strong>http://www.jakearmijo.com</strong>.</p>\n      <p class=\"listItem\">3.) Verify that you are the owner of the domain. </p>\n      <p class=\"listItem\">4.) Click \"verify\".</p>\n      <p class=\"listItem\">5.) You will be redirected to your domain settings where you will see your domain. You will see that your domain will have a warning, to ask you to \"check your DNS configuration\". Click to Options -> Set Up Netlify DNS.</p>\n      <p class=\"listItem\">6.) Add domain - Netlify will ask you to re-verify your domain name</p>\n      <p class=\"listItem\">7.) Add DNS records - The DNS records for your Netlify sites will be configured automatically. I did not have an email account with the domain so I skipped this part.</p>\n      <p class=\"listItem\">8.) Activate Netlify DNS - Nelify will give you names of their name savers. Keep them open and head to google domains.</p>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"border\">\n    <img\n      class=\"border\"\n      width=\"50%\"\n      height=\"50%\"\n      alt=\"Google Domains\"\n      title=\"Google Domains\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.freelogovectors.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-domains-logo-768x716.png\"\n      data-canonical-src=\"https://cdn.freelogovectors.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-domains-logo-768x716.png\"\n    />\n  </div>\n</br>\n<h3>Google Domains</h3>\n<ol>\n  <p className='listItem'>1.) Navigate to your domain settings</p>\n  <p className='listItem'>2.) Click DNS\n  <p className='listItem'>3.) In the NameServers box, select the option \"Use custom nameservers\". Before I was able to add the custom domains, it made me disable DNSSEC.\n  <p className='listItem'>4.) Add the name servers from Netlify to the Google name servers.\n</ol>\n</br>\n<p>Congrats! Your domain is set up - it may take more time but mine was ready within minuets. <a href='http://www.jakearmijo.com'>http://www.jakearmijo.com</a> was born.</p>\n<p>Netlify will also set up the HTTPS certificate via https://letsencrypt.org/donate/. This process took a little longer but when I awoke in the morning I had the HTTPS before the URL and my site was not receiving the privacy warning.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Jake Armijo <bold>|</bold> Full Stack Software Engineer\nArmijojake@yahoo.com\nConnect with me on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-armijo/'>LinkedIn</a>\nSchedule a meeting with me on <a href='https://calendly.com/armijojake/meeting'>Calendly</a></p>\n","title":"How I launched my portfolio site with Google Domains and Netlify","date":"2021-05-16","category":"Tutorial","template":"blog-post","tags":"Google Domains, Netlify, Nextjs, Gatsby, DNS, Portfolio Site"}},"__N_SSG":true}
