I looked at different tech options and tried to select which one would be best. I knew <strong><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a></strong> were popular choices so I mainly researched those. After Boot camp, I did make a full React-based portfolio, but it was large and slow on load time. I knew I could research how to improve this, but I thought I would change the pace and try something new. I was reading about how server-side rendering would be better for load time. I chose Next over Gatsby because I thought it was a bit newer. I enjoyed the Next tutorials while going through them, so I converted the React-based project into a Next.js project.</p>\n<p>When I started to research domains and where to purchase them, I checked GoDaddy first (just because I'm 30 and I've always seen and heard their name) I also stumbled into Google Domains which I quickly leaned towards as the price was even with the range I was seeing and I wanted to have something from a brand I knew. I also came across sites such as  A2, Bluehost, Netlify, or Namecheap. I honestly have no advice as I'm sure if you have made it this far the process is decently simple with any provider you chose. In the end, the final check-out price was $12 for 1 year that I set to reoccurring. There was also an option on there to have a \"work\" email address. For example, you can choose info@jakearmijo.com or something along those lines. This was an addon for Google Workspace and was $6 per user per month and came with 30GB of cloud storage.</p>\n<p>I watched this <strong><a href=\"https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/nextjs\">incredible tutorial</a></strong> by Cassidoo and I applied it to my site in order to get it up and running with a basic Netlify URL. The process for Netlify to add my custom domain after I had purchased it from google domains is posted below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../public/images/netlifyLogo.png\" alt=\"Netlify\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Step By Step How To - Netlify</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>In your Netlify console, navigate to your site and click Domain Settings. Click the green button \"Add a custom domain\".</li>\n<li>It will prompt you to provide the name of the domain you have bought. For example <strong><a href=\"https://www.jakearmijo.com\">https://www.jakearmijo.com</a></strong>.</li>\n<li>Verify that you are the owner of the domain.</li>\n<li>Click \"verify\".</li>\n<li>You will be redirected to your domain settings where you will see your domain. You will see that your domain will have a warning, asking you to \"check your DNS configuration\". Click to Options -> Set Up Netlify DNS.</li>\n<li>Add domain - Netlify will ask you to re-verify your domain name</li>\n<li>Add DNS records - The DNS records for your Netlify sites will be configured automatically. I did not have an email account with the domain so I skipped this part.</li>\n<li>Activate Netlify DNS - Nelify will give you the names of their name savers. Keep them open and head to google domains.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Google Domains</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../public/images/google-domains-logo.png\" alt=\"GoogleDomains\"></p>\n<h3>Step By Step How To - Google</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to your domain settings</li>\n<li>Click DNS</li>\n<li>In the NameServers box, select the option \"Use custom nameservers\". Before I was able to add the custom domains, it made me disable DNSSEC.</li>\n<li>Add the name servers from Netlify to the Google name servers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Congrats! Your domain is set up - it may take more time but mine was ready within minutes. That is how <a href=\"https://www.jakearmijo.com\">https://www.jakearmijo.com</a> was born.</p>\n<p>Netlify will also set up the HTTPS certificate via <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/donate/\">letsencrypt.org</a>. This process took a little longer but when I awoke in the morning I had the HTTPS before the URL and my site was not receiving a privacy warning.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jakearmijo.com/\">Jake Armijo</a> <strong>|</strong> Full Stack Software Engineer\n</p>\n<p>Connect with me on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-armijo/\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n<p>Schedule a meeting with me on <a href=\"https://calendly.com/armijojake/meeting\">Calendly</a></p>\n","title":"How I launched my portfolio site with Google Domains and Netlify","date":"2022-05-16","category":"Tutorial","template":"blog-post","tags":"Google Domains, Netlify, Nextjs, Gatsby, DNS, Portfolio Site"}},"__N_SSG":true}
