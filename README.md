## # Jake Armijo dot com

This is the start of a digital playground and website that I can express myself a bit with. I have successfully changed careers and want to continue to push new boundries. I have a few proejcts in the works. I will be making a mini <a href="/#jakeblog">blog</a> that will be posted in at random with zero consistency. There is a NHl app entitled <a href="/todaystilts">Today's Tilts</a>, and still working on <a href="/BTPAcustomcable">BTPA custom cable builder</a>, as well as a few other things. Thats enough jabber though. Welcome to the space. Enjoy and please feel free to reach out.
