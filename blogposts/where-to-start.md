This will be an article about why I started at a start up.

- **Start up** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Larger Brands** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, **What sold me** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
