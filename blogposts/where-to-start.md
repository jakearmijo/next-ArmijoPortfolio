Topic: This will be an article about why I started at a start up.
### 3 pools of companies
- **Start up** is a face paced environment where you are engaged in daily **coding** work and practices. If you get a chance. I do feel a start up is worth it ..
- **Brands** usually has a established **tech stack**.
- **Consultants/Agency** usually has a **wide range** of technoogies. These technologies are dependent on client's needs are could vary.

Importantly, **What sold me** was the knowledge I was going to be exposed to. Start up's tend to be smaller teams where you will handle and touch a lot of code. It gives you an opportunity to dive into their tech stack and be a short distance away to turn and ask a question when needed. Start up's tend to move fast and preach that agility is a main strength to omving into a success long term path. This environment of moving fast tosses you in the mix at a rate that, for a post bootcamp graduate, is awesome! You will have opportunity to work solo, pair program, group program, and more.
