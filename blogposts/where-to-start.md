This will be an article about why I started at a start up.

3 pools of companies -> go into explaining 

- **Start up** is a face paced environment where you are engaged in daily **coding** work and practices. If you get a chance. I do feel a start up is worth it ..
- **Larger Brands** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, **What sold me** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
