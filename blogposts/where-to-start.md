## Where to start your SDE career

After graduating bootcamp I landed a job at a Chicago start-up. During the job hunt phase I was always reading job desriptions and looking at different companies websites. It is a lot of information to take in. Where do you start? Which company do you choose?  For most people that answer - I think - is the first place to give you an offer. Use this in your search to aid in your decision making. I like to think of companies in three pools.

- **Start ups** is a face paced environment where you are engaged in daily **coding** work and practices.
- **Brands** usually has a established **tech stack**.
- **Agencies** usually has a **wide range** of technoogies. These technologies are dependent on client's needs and could vary.

## Start Up

Start ups are a great place for you to start up... These companies have a tendency to be more modern. Most likely everyday you will be coding and learning in a defined tech stack. I assume with the rise of cloud technologies some of these companies will also be able to give you experience with a major cloud provider. Start-ups come in a varity of sizes but usually lean towards the smaller end. This is an advantage when trying to gain xp and learn. Your teamates sit close to you and can assist with issues or questions. These environments are faster paced and very agile. I am generally speaking so people may have different experiences or opinoins. You will be involved in daily coding stand ups, roadmap discussions, and depending on the size maybe even some marketing and business aquisition. In my experience these companies dont always pay as much as brands or agencies. My entry level salary was only $55k. The knowledge and experience gained is the trade off for the money. Sometimes these companies will have offer stock or ownership in your contract. Just be very careful here while in negotiation cause unless you really have a connection with these people they are only looking out for their "baby" (product) and will say what they can to get you on board at a lower salary. This isnt always true but just weary while you swim through these waters... There are sharks around. In the end the xp and the knowledge gained,as stated before , is of more value to you anyway unless you see yourself staying there forever. If you get a chance. I do feel a start up is worth the time investment but again just make sure you are going to learning, building your skills, developing your technical lingo, and expanding your professional network.

## Brands

Here I want to talk about a specific brand and showcase that they are a defined tech stack that you would learn and get good with.

- Hubspot
- Pampered Chef
- Banks
- Workday

## Consultants

Here I want to talk about my current expeirnece and how I have already learned new technologies and researching more everyday.

## Importantly

**What sold me** was the knowledge I was going to be exposed to. Start up's tend to be smaller teams where you will handle and touch a lot of code. It gives you an opportunity to dive into their tech stack and be a short distance away to turn and ask a question when needed. Start up's tend to move fast and preach that agility is a main strength to moving into a success long term path. This environment of moving fast tosses you in the mix at a rate that, for a post bootcamp graduate, is awesome! You will have opportunity to work solo, pair program, group program, and more.
