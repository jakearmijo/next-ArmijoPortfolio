## Where to start your SDE career

After graduating bootcamp I landed a job at a Chicago start-up. During the job hunt phase I was always reading job desriptions and looking at different companies websites. It is a lot of information to take in. Where do you start? Which company do you choose?  For most people that answer - I think - is the first place to give you an offer. Use this in your search to aid in your decisuion making. I like to think of companies in three pools.

- **Start ups** is a face paced environment where you are engaged in daily **coding** work and practices.
- **Brands** usually has a established **tech stack**.
- **Agencies** usually has a **wide range** of technoogies. These technologies are dependent on client's needs and could vary.

## Start Up
Start ups are a great place for you to start up... These companies have a tendency to be more modern. Most likely everyday you will be coding and learning in a defined tech stack. I assume with the rise of cloud some of these companies will also give ytou expiernce with a major  cloud provider. They come in a varity of sizes but usually lean towards the smaller end. This is an advantage when trying to gain xp and learn. Your teamates sit close to you They are very fast paced and collabortive. I am generally speaking so people may have different expiernces. I want to explain in this section the use of new tech stacks and how you truly code everyday. If you get a chance. I do feel a start up is worth it ..

## Brands
Here I want to talk about a specific brand and showcase that they are a defined tech stack that you would learn and get good with .

## Consultants
Here I want to talk about my current expeirnece and how I have already learned new technologies and researching more everyday.

## Importantly

**What sold me** was the knowledge I was going to be exposed to. Start up's tend to be smaller teams where you will handle and touch a lot of code. It gives you an opportunity to dive into their tech stack and be a short distance away to turn and ask a question when needed. Start up's tend to move fast and preach that agility is a main strength to moving into a success long term path. This environment of moving fast tosses you in the mix at a rate that, for a post bootcamp graduate, is awesome! You will have opportunity to work solo, pair program, group program, and more.
