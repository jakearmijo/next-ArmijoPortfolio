# Why do Docker Image Sizes grow?

Docker images can quickly grow in size, which can lead to slower builds and deployments, increased storage costs, and longer download times. There are several reasons why Docker images can grow in size, including:

1. **Including unnecessary files and packages**: One of the most common reasons for large Docker images is including unnecessary files and packages. When building a Docker image, it's important to only include the files and packages that are required for the application to run. Docker images can contain files that are not needed for the application to run, such as development files or test files.

2. **Using large base images**: The base image that you choose for your Docker image can also impact the overall size of the image. Some base images, such as Ubuntu or CentOS, can be quite large and include many unnecessary packages.

3. **Including Build Artifacts**: If you're building your application within a Docker image, it's important to ensure that any build artifacts, such as intermediate files or build dependencies, are removed from the final image.

4. **Not cleaning up after builds**: Docker layers can be reused between builds, but if files are not removed between builds, the size of the image can grow.

5. **Not Compressing Files**: Finally, not compressing files within your Docker image can also lead to larger image sizes. Compression can significantly reduce the size of files within an image, which can help to reduce the overall size of the image.

## Steps to Reduce the Size of Your Docker Image

Here are some steps that you can take to reduce the size of your Docker image:

1. **Use a smaller base image**: Instead of using a base image based on Ubuntu or CentOS, consider using a smaller base image like Alpine. Alpine is a Linux distribution that is designed to be small and secure, making it a great choice for Docker images.

2. **Remove unnecessary files**: Be sure to exclude files that are not needed for the application to run, such as development files or test files. Use the **`.dockerignore`** file to exclude files and directories from the build context. Similarly, make sure to remove any unnecessary files or build artifacts from the final image. This can help to further reduce the size of the image.

3. **Use multi-stage builds**: Using multi-stage builds can help to separate the build process from the runtime environment, which can help to reduce the size of the final image. In a multi-stage build, you can use a larger base image for the build environment, then copy only the necessary files into a smaller base image for the runtime environment.

4. **Install Only Necessary Packages**: Using a package manager, like **`apk`** or **`yum`**, only install the packages that are needed for the application to run. This can help reduce the size of the final image.

5. **Clean up after builds**: Be sure to clean up after builds by removing temporary files and unused packages.

6. Use **`COPY`** instead of **`ADD`**: When adding files to your Docker image, use **`COPY`** instead of **`ADD`**. **`ADD`** can modify files during the build process, which can lead to larger image sizes.

7. Use **`-no-cache`** when building: By default, Docker uses a cache when building images to speed up the process. However, this can lead to larger image sizes. Use the **`-no-cache`** option to disable the cache and force Docker to rebuild the image from scratch.

8. **Compress Files**: Finally, consider compressing files within your Docker image to further reduce the size of the image. For example, you can use ```gzip``` to compress log files or other large files within the image.

### Example Dockerfile

Here's an example Dockerfile that incorporates some of these steps to help reduce the size of the final Docker image:

```Docker
  # Use a smaller base image
  FROM alpine:latest

  # Install only the necessary packages
  RUN apk add --no-cache nodejs npm

  # Copy only the necessary files
  COPY package.json .
  COPY index.js .

  # Install dependencies
  RUN npm install --production

  # Use a multi-stage build
  FROM alpine:latest
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY --from=0 /package.json .
  COPY --from=0 /index.js .
  COPY --from=0 /node_modules /node_modules

  # Compress files
  RUN gzip -r /app

  # Set the command to run the application
  CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

In this example, we're using Alpine as our base image, installing only the necessary packages, and copying only the necessary files. We're also using a multi-stage build to separate the build process from the runtime environment. By adding the ```gzip``` command to the build process, we're able to compress our files and reduce the size of the final Docker image. When the image is loaded into a container, the compressed files will be automatically decompressed, allowing the container to run as expected.

It's important to note that while compressing our files can reduce the size of the final Docker image, it can also increase the time it takes to build the image. If build time is a concern, you may want to consider compressing the files separately or using a different compression method.
